/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   /thank-you

   Where the enquiry form goes on a send that resolved. It is not decoration:
   reaching this URL is the event Google Ads counts as a conversion, and the
   only place the site fires `generate_lead`. Sending the form's success state
   here rather than swapping a panel in place is what makes the conversion
   countable at all.

   NOINDEX, PERMANENTLY. A thank-you page has nothing to offer a search
   result, and one that is indexed gets landed on cold, which reports a
   conversion for a visitor who never enquired. The layout's pre-launch
   noindex is a separate thing with its own deletion note; this one stays
   after cutover.

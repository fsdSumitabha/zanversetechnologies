/* ── Card artwork ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Two sets of pictures for the same subjects, and a section picks whichever
   it wants:

     · DRAWN PLATES, at the bottom of this file. Hand-drawn 160 x 100 SVG in
       ink and neutral greys on a transparent ground, nothing coloured, so the
       card can multiply them into a plate tinted with the brand's gold
       (.zan-deck-plate in components/zan/services/deck.css). An <img> cannot
       read a CSS variable, so a colour baked into the file would sit outside
       the palette tokens and stay behind when they change. None of them
       carries one.
     · PHOTOGRAPHS, below. One per subject, 1200 x 750 JPEG under 120 KB,
       cropped with the subject in the middle so a cover crop never loses it.
       A photograph cannot take the gold tint; a card showing one drops the
       tint and keeps the accent as a hairline instead.

   ── The photographs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One per card subject: a service, a step of the process, an industry, a
   reason to hire us.

   The services reuse the hero photograph their own page already carries
   (constants/serviceHero.ts) rather than shipping a second file, so a service
   looks like itself in the deck, in the catalogue, in the "other services"
   list and at the top of its page. The four Blockchain & Web3 lines on the
   homepage deck have no page of their own, so their pictures live here.

   The files are 1200 x 750 JPEG, each under 120 KB (the heroes are the larger
   2000 x 1125). next/image serves the responsive sizes from there and the
   card crops with object-cover, so the subject sits in the middle of every
   frame and no crop loses it.

   `alt` is empty on purpose. The subject's name is the card's own heading, an
   inch from the picture, and a screen reader given both would say it twice.
   The hero band on /services/[...slug] is where a written alt belongs, and
   serviceHero.ts carries one for each of those.

   Licences. Every file came from Pexels or Unsplash, both of which allow
   commercial use with no attribution and no permission. `source` is the URL
   the file was taken from: a record of where it came from, kept so the
   provenance of each one can be checked later, not a credit the page owes.

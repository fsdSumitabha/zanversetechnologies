/* ── Service photography ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   One photograph per service page, keyed the way the rest of the per-service
   tables are: by the last segment of the page's slug, which is its `priceKey`
   in constants/pages.ts.

   Two surfaces draw these. The hero band of /services/[...slug] is the first,
   at full width. The second is constants/serviceArt.ts, whose `getServiceArt`
   reuses the same entries for the service cards — the catalogue on /services,
   the discipline grids, the "other services" lists — so a service looks like
   itself wherever it is named rather than shipping a second file for a
   thumbnail. The homepage deck is the one place that does not: it keeps the
   hand-drawn SVG plates that live in that same file, because a drawing can be
   multiplied into a plate tinted with the brand's gold and a photograph
   cannot.

   Every picture has to be OF the service, not near it. The SEO page shows a
   search performance report, the influencer page a phone on a tripod, the
   cloud page a real data hall. A smiling person at a laptop would have done
   for all sixteen, which is the reason none of them is that.

   The files are 2000 x 1125 JPEG, each under 240 KB, and next/image serves
   the responsive sizes from there. They are cropped to 16:9 so the band can
   take a wider slice on a desktop and a squarer one on a phone through
   object-cover; the subject sits in the middle of every frame so no crop
   loses it.

   The `alt` is written out because the hero band is the one place the picture
   stands on its own, above the fold and away from any list. `getServiceArt`
   blanks it when it borrows the entry for a card, where the card's own heading
   names the subject an inch away and a screen reader given both would say it
   twice.

   Licences. Every file came from Unsplash or Pexels, both of which allow
   commercial use with no attribution and no permission. `source` is the URL
   the file was taken from — a record of where it came from, kept so the
   provenance of each one can be checked later, not a credit the page owes.

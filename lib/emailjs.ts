   EMAILJS

   EmailJS is a browser-side service: the enquiry form posts straight from the
   visitor to their API, so all three values have to reach the client and all
   three are NEXT_PUBLIC_ by necessity, not by oversight. The "public key" is
   named that way by EmailJS for the same reason — it identifies the account,
   it does not authorise anything on its own.

   That does mean anyone can read these out of the bundle and post to the same
   template. The control for that is not secrecy, it is the allow-list:

     EmailJS dashboard -> Account -> Security -> "Allowed origins"

   List the production domain (site.url in constants/zan.ts) and nothing that
   is not production. Without it, a key lifted from the bundle can be used to
   send from any origin, which is how these accounts get burned through their
   quota by spam. An account shared with another site lists that site's
   domain as well.

   The values live in .env.local, which is gitignored; .env.example lists the
   names.

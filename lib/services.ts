/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Which service a path is about.

   The enquiry form asks the visitor to choose a service, and a visitor who
   has just read a page about web development should not then have to tell us
   they are interested in web development. The form lives on /contact-us and
   in the homepage's contact section rather than on the service pages
   themselves, so those pages hand the answer over in the link they send:

     /contact-us?from=/services/web-development

   The values are the ones the form's `serviceOptions` offers, because both are
   built from `practices`. The two practice hubs (/services/digital-marketing,
   /services/branding-and-designing) are headings rather than services and have
   no option of their own, so they fall through to "" and the form keeps its
   "Choose a service" placeholder.

   Its own module, and not part of lib/links.ts, so that lib/links.ts stays a
   handful of string helpers rather than pulling the whole content file in.

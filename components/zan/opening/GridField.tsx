/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   GRID FIELD — the hero's ground.

   A drawing board rather than a pattern: a fine 24px rule with a heavier one
   every fourth line, both in ink at a few per cent, and then the four things
   that stop it reading as graph paper —

     · glow    one wide pool of the brand's light under the mark, so the
               sheet has a centre and the corners fall away;
     · cells   a handful of squares light up in that colour and fade, each on
               its own clock, so the grid is never the same twice;
     · ticks   register marks — a drafting cross — on the major intersections,
               breathing;
     · sweep   one slow band of light crossing the whole field.

   Everything is CSS on positions computed once from a fixed seed, so the
   server and every browser draw the same grid, there is no canvas and no
   per-frame work, and `prefers-reduced-motion` simply stops it — the layout
   is identical either way. Where the grid may show is decided by the mask in
   opening.css: it dissolves behind the copy so nothing is ruled through.

/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The enquiry form, wired to EmailJS.

   It used to set window.location.href to a mailto: URL and then call
   setSent(true) on the next line, unconditionally. On a machine with no mail
   handler — desktop Chrome by default, most locked-down work machines, most
   Android phones — nothing opened and the visitor was told the enquiry had
   been sent. Long project descriptions were also truncated silently by the
   query string. Every one of those enquiries was lost.

   EmailJS posts from the browser straight to their API, so there is no route
   of ours in the path and nothing to deploy server-side. The trade is that the
   credentials are in the bundle; see lib/emailjs.ts for why that is expected
   and what actually protects the account.

   Three things this now does that the mailto did not:

     - It refuses to pretend. With no credentials configured it does not render
       a form at all, it renders the address.
     - It reports failure. A rejected send puts the message back in front of
       the visitor with the address to fall back on, instead of a success state
       that did not happen. The mailto survives, but only as "or email us
       directly", never as a submission.
     - It carries a honeypot. Public forms are found by bots within days; a
       field no human can see is the cheapest filter that does not tax people.

   A send that succeeds goes to /thank-you, which is where the Google Ads
   conversion is counted.

   Validation is still the browser's own constraint API (required, type=email,
   pattern, minLength) with the messages written out inline under each field,
   instead of the native bubbles.

   It renders in three places: the homepage's contact section, /contact-us, and
   the contact modal, which asks for `compact`. There the dialog is the card and
   carries the heading, so the form gives up both and tightens its rows to stay
   readable on a phone. The homepage asks for `fill`: from 1024px the card is
   at least as tall as its column, so it ends level with the office card
   beside it, and the project-details box takes the extra height.

/**
 * The top of every standing page: the trail back up, the same eyebrow,
 * display heading and lead the homepage's sections use, then whatever the page
 * puts under it (its calls to action) and beside it.
 *
 * Two rules hold across every page type:
 *
 *   1. The heading is ink. A whole headline filled with the brand colour is a
 *      large area of saturated colour, which this site reserves for buttons and
 *      small accents — and gold on white is about 1.7:1, so a filled headline
 *      is not even legible. Only a heading of more than one line takes the
 *      accent, and only on its last line.
 *   2. The band is a two-column grid at lg and up. The right column carries
 *      something real (what a service includes, the company's facts, the
 *      figures), so the hero is a filled band rather than copy in the top-left
 *      corner of an empty screen.
 *
 * `media` adds a third part under both columns, for the pages that have a
 * photograph. It sits below the copy rather than behind or beside it, so the
 * heading, the lead and the buttons are all above it at every width and none
 * of them is ever read off a picture.
 *
 * `pt-nav` clears the fixed navbar. The ground is the warm brand wash, and the
 * section that follows draws the hairline between them.

 * `preload` because this is the largest thing above the fold and therefore the
 * page's LCP element — `priority` is the Next 15 spelling and is deprecated in
 * 16 (node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/image.md).

/**
 * The assistant's mark.
 *
 * The main app put a Lottie robot on the launcher and a sparkle icon in the
 * panel header. Neither ships here: the client does not want Lottie, and the
 * brief rules out sparkle glyphs. This is the replacement — a drawn speech
 * frame with a reply line inside it, in currentColor, so it takes the brand
 * accent of whatever it sits on, costs no request and animates nothing.

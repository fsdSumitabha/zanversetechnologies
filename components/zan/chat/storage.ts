 * The chat token, kept in localStorage so a visitor who opens the panel again

 *
 * One key for the whole site, so a thread started on one page carries on, on
 * every other page the panel opens on.
 *
 * Every accessor is guarded. Safari private mode throws on localStorage rather
 * than returning null, and an unguarded read there would break the panel.

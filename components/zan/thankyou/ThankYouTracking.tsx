 * them here.
 *
 * The details come from sessionStorage, written by the enquiry form on a send
 * that resolved, and are cleared as they are read, so a reload of this page
 * cannot report the same lead twice. A visitor who opens /thank-you directly
 * has nothing stored: the event still fires, with the two fields empty, as it
 * did on the company's earlier site, so the container sees one shape of event.

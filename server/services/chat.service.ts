   CHAT ORCHESTRATION

   The single decision this file makes: when a client message arrives, does the
   AI answer it, or does it get relayed to a human on WhatsApp?

   That is determined by conversation state and nothing else — never by the
   model. An AI that could decide "I'll take this one" after a human has taken
   over is an AI that talks over your sales team.

 * AI provider returned 429, and telling them so reads as an excuse. Every
